Introduction
------------

GPhotoCamera is a simple Python wrapper around a small subset of libgphoto2, in particular it is only useful for capturing live preview frames and actual images from a libgphoto2 compatible camera.

Note: As of the writing of this file gphoto2 was at version 2.4.8 and only really runs on Linux (we tested in Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04).

More information about gphoto can be found here:

More information about ctypes can be found here:

Please Note: I originally developed this for a school project where we had access to a Canon7D and this code is known to work well with it. Since then I haven't had access to any compatible cameras and haven't had the opportunity to verify this code still works for newer versions of Linux/libgphoto2.


Prerequisites
-------------

A Linux distro (tested on Ubuntu 10.04) with libgphoto2 installed (tested with libgphoto2.so.2).
Python >= 2.6 (haven't tested on 3.0)


Example
-------

cam = GPhotoCamera();
cam.capture_preview('preview.jpg');
cam.capture_image('full_image.jpg');
